description: >-
  Photo DNA compiles a digital signature of images (or a “fingerprint”), which
  can be matched against a database of known child-pornography images, thus
  significantly reducing the time law enforcement officers spend viewing these
  images to determine if the child victims have already been identified or are
  currently at-risk.
